# CS152
## Completed
- Mil code generates for:
  - fibonacci.min
  - primes.min
  - mytest.min

- Error checking:

## Incompleted
- Incomplete code generations for:
  - for loops
  - continue
- Error checking remaining:
  - Using a variable without having first declared it.
  - Defining a variable more than once (it should also be an error to declare a variable with the same name as the MINI-L program itself).
  - Forgetting to specify an array index when using an array variable (i.e., trying to use an array variable as a regular integer variable).
  - Specifying an array index when using a regular integer variable (i.e., trying to use a regular integer variable as an array variable).
  - Using continue statement outside a loop.
